print('She said: "Hello" and then left ')

#''' So how do you solve this? Well, a really simple way is to alternate the use of single and double quotes.'''

print('She said: "Hello" and then left.')

#'''Now, another alternative option'''

print("She said: \"Hello\" and then left")



print("A 'single quote' inside a double quote")
print('A "double quote" inside a single quote')
print("Alternatively you can just \"escape\" the quote")
